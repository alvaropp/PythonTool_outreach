Put the ResetWorld.bat script into the .minecraft folder inside appdata/roaming
with a backup world called World1 in a folder called BackUpWorld.
It will remove the current World1 and replace it with the backup world.
It will also remove all the scripts inside of PythonToolScripts and copy in
all the scripts from the BackUpScripts directory. It increments the number of runs
inside of the NumberOfRuns.dat file and you must enter a score (between 0 and 5) for
the engagement of the participant that is appended to the EngagementScores.dat file.

Directory structure should be like so:

Inside .minecraft
