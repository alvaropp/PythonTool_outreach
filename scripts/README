Put the ResetWorld.bat script into the .minecraft folder inside appdata/roaming
with a backup world called World1 in a folder called BackUpWorld. It will remove the current World1 and replace it with the backup world.

Directory structure should be like so:

Inside .minecraft

.
├── ResetWorld.bat
├── BackUpWorld
│   ├── World1
├── saves
│   ├── World1
